    Insertion Sort:
    
    Time Complexity : Best => O(n) , Worst & Average => O(n*n)
    Space Complexity: O(1) 
    Stablitiy       : Stable
    Is-In-Place     : In-Place
    When to use     : 1. If array is of small size and nearly sorted
    Remark          : Standard Libraray of C uses this algo when n becomes smaller
                        than a threshold and for small size it is better than merge
                        and quick sort becasue of low constant values and non
                        recusive in nature.
